Personalized Prospect Theory Value Curves (because it's fun!)

These programs play around with establishing Individualized Prospect Theory Value Curves. Asking 20 Sure Bet/Lottery Tasks we determine parameter values for individuals' dimninishing gain/loss sensitivities and loss aversion. We  use parameters from the original Tversky & Kahnemann (1992) estimates as prior information to update in light of the individuals' item responses. Then we compute and plot a curve for them. Two versions of updating are used: MLE and Bayesian. The Bayesian Update also gives credible intervals for uncertainty quantification. The Bayesian Update also throws error messages, which i'll need to look closer at, however, it doesn't seem to interfere with results (they make sense). I've added a small value in the negative log-likelihood to prevent log(0) boundary problems when doing the logistic choice model.
