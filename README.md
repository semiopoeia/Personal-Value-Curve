Personalized Prospect Theory Value Curves (because it's fun!)

These programs play around with establishing Individualized Prospect Theory Value Curves. Asking 20 Sure Bet/Lottery Tasks we determine parameter values for individuals' dimninishing gain/loss sensitivities and loss aversion. We  use parameters from the original Tversky & Kahnemann (1992) estimates as prior information to update in light of the individuals' item responses. Then we compute and plot a curve for them. Two versions of updating are used: MLE and Bayesian. The Bayesian Update also gives credible intervals for uncertainty quantification.
